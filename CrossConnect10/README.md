This project is for CrossConnect as a Windows 10 Universal app.  This works only in Windows 10 and since Windows 10 is not released yet this is somewhat of a beta version. 
This works very well and is somewhat tested but there is still one thing not working and that is OneDrive access.  This is because LiveSDK is not released yet for Windows 10.
