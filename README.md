Cross Connect is a bible and bible commentary reader based on the crosswire.org (the sword project) bible database that has over 160 bibles and documents in over 50 languages. This includes a connection to the cross-wire server to retrieve bibles from. This is a multi-window application where you can see several bibles at a time and compare bibles and notes as well as keeping a history of what you do and bookmarking interesting verses. You can add your own personal notes to each verse. Advanced searching is included as well. You can SMS or Email Bible verses to your friends and loved ones. Advanced features include Ancient Greek and Hebrew word translations as well as morphology. There are several Bible reading plans that span from 30 days to one year with many different methods for covering the Bible. All texts appearing in the program are translated into over 40 languages. If you get tired of reading the bible then you can listen to it instead by choosing one of the many audio versions of the bible.  Google translations are integrated into most windows so if you study in a language you donâ€™t fully understand you can usually translate it to your language.
